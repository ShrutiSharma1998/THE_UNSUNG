# THE_UNSUNG


Unsung is a student-run- chapter which aimed to bring out and talk about the Unprecendted issues in our country. It was co-founded by me and my friend.

Initially we were aided by 2 more students, and we took up important topics to discuss with our audience.
We released our first e-magazine with 3 differnet verisons (which has been uploaded, except volume 2 as it is too big).
I was able to network with advocates of supreme court and various business tycoon in my endeavour.

Our e-magazine was highly appreciated and accepted by the audience. Within 72 hours we had over 7000+ downloads. We collaborated with various other organisation Pan-India.
A video was also created during the process, in collaboration with another organization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecS6sIbcNXM&t=142s

We continued to enagage with our audience via social media platforms on various topics and also successfully conducted an open-mic event.
The event consisted of 100+ delegates and speakers who were business tycoons, former RBI members and it turned to be a lucrative event.
